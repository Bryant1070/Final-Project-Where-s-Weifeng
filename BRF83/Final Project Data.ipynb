    "The purpose of this project was to determine which neighborhoods in Pittsburgh that had the most health complications and least health care access. At first, my group members discussed health complications due to Pittsburgh itself e.i. fast food restaurants and air quality. However, after looking through the data sets provided by West Pennsylvania Regional Data center, we came to the conclusion that there were more usable data sets that pertained to more medical health complications. And so, we decided that our submetrics would be: Diabetes rates, Obesity rates, and locations nearby hospitals"
